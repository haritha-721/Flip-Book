Flipbooks are currently used to replace conventional digital PDFs and paper-based documents such as reports, presentations, magazines, catalogs, brochures, books and more. 
A digital flipbook looks and feels exactly like a printed publication with pages that can be flipped and turned - without the cost of printing!ðŸ˜Œ
